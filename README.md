### Preregistration
This systematic review and meta-analysis was preregistered on PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42019151889. The pre-registration can be accessed [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=151889).

### Archive contents
This archive contains the [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) code for the analysis reported in the above study. The code is presented as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) which are documents that combine both code and the output in a form that can be viewed online, but also re-run and the results reproduced when accompanied by the original dataset.

This repository contains a dataset with the extracted meta-analytic data and a Jupyter notebook that reports the analysis and results

1.  [delusion_theme_meta_data.csv](https://github.com/ElisavetPappa/delusion_theme_meta/blob/main/delusion_theme_meta_data.csv) - datafile that contains extracted data
2.  [Pappa_et_al_meta_struct_only.ipynb](https://github.com/ElisavetPappa/delusion_theme_meta/blob/main/Pappa_et_al_meta_struct_only.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook that contains the reproducible analysis for the meta-analysis of validated and structured assessments only
3.  [Pappa_et_al_meta_inclusive.ipynb](https://github.com/ElisavetPappa/delusion_theme_meta/blob/main/Pappa_et_al_meta_inclusive.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook that contains the reproducible analysis for the meta-analysis including clinical and ad-hoc assessments
4.  [HumanFriendlyLabels.csv](https://github.com/ElisavetPappa/delusion_theme_meta/blob/main/HumanFriendlyLabels.csv) - human readable delusion theme names used to display friendly results in the analysis

### Platform and package versions

To aid reproducibility, the platform (hardware, operating system), R language version, and package versions used to generate the results are automatically generated at runtime and reported at the end of the Jupyter notebook.
